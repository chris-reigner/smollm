    "Long story short, Quantized Low-rank adaption is a fine tuning technique that allows the model:\n",

    "- to adapt adding one or several adapters on the top of the original weights\n",

Police spokesman Tomas Hulan says it is not certain what caused the blast in Divadelni Street, but it was likely a natural gas explosion . The street was covered with rubble and has been sealed off by police who have also evacuated people from nearby buildings and closed a wide area around the explosion site. Injured: A powerful explosion has damaged a building in the centre of the Czech capital Prague with people feared buried in the rubble . Cause: Police said it is not immediately clear what caused the blast in Divadelni Street this morning, but it was probably a gas explosion . Investigation: The street is covered with rubble and has been sealed off by police . Zdenek Schwarz, head of the rescue service in Prague, says up to 40 people have been injured. Windows in buildings located hundreds of metres from the blast were shattered, including some in the nearby National Theatre. The explosion was heard as far as Prague Castle about a . mile (1.6 km) across the Vltava river. A . police spokesman said that there had been about 15 people in the . building, which included an office of the International Air Transport . Association (IATA) and an art gallery. Firefighters spokeswoman Pavlina Adamcova said rescuers were still searching the rubble, using sniffer dogs. Rescue service spokeswoman Jirina Ernestova said there were foreigners among the injured but had no further details immediately. Some of the injured were taken to Prague's hospitals for treatment while others, many of whom were hit by flying glass, were treated by rescuers at the scene. Hurt: An injured man removes his shirt before receiving medical treatment . Injured women are helped away from the scene of the blast in the Czech capital, Prague . Damage: Windows in buildings located hundreds of metres from the blast were shattered, including some in the nearby National Theatre . Tourists at the famed Charles Bridge also felt the blast. 'There was glass everywhere and people shouting and crying,' Vaclav Rokyta, a Czech student said near the scene. 'I was in the bathroom, no windows, . the door was closed. Honestly, if I had been in my bed I would have been . covered in glass,' said Z.B. Haislip, a student from Raleigh, North . Carolina, who was in a nearby building. The Faculty of Social Sciences of Prague's Charles University and the Film and TV School of the Academy of Sciences of Performing Arts are located next to the damaged building. Prime Minister Petr Necas said in a statement he was 'deeply hit by the tragedy of the gas explosion. The road closures caused major traffic disruption and confused thousands of tourists. Some new arrivals to the city had to stand on street corners, unable to reach their hotels, their baggage loaded onto trolleys. Hotel staff urged them to be patient.

It was more serious for Fabio Capello's team, who had to come from two goals down after goalkeeper Joe Hart was badly caught out by two free-kicks from Tranquillo Barnetta just after half an hour. Frank Lampard reduced the deficit with a penalty before halftime and his replacement Ashley Young leveled soon after coming on at the interval. The result meant Montenegro joined England on 11 points at the top of Group G after five games after also being held at home, 1-1 by Bulgaria. Bulgaria and the Swiss have little chance of earning second place and a berth in the playoffs, with both nations having five points with three matches left. England next travel to Bulgaria on September 2, when Montenegro visit pointless bottom nation Wales. Hart looked on in bemusement as Barnetta's curling set-piece drifted past his defenders and into the far corner in the 32nd minute, and he was caught out at the near post by the same player from wide out on the left soon after. However, Lampard made it 2-1 in the 36th minute when Jack Wilshere was fouled in the box by his Arsenal teammate Johan Djourou, and Young leveled six minutes after his halftime introduction after being set up by fellow substitute Leighton Baines. Striker Darren Bent blazed over the bar when he should have hit the target for England with 20 minutes left, and both teams went close in the closing stages. England manager Capello said his players were tired after a long season. \\\"You can see the Switzerland players were fresher. They have had a different season,\\\" the Italian said. \\\"We had three clear chances to score goals but at the end of the game, in the last 10 minutes, some players were without energy.\\\" Slovakia, Russia and the Republic of Ireland are tied on 13 points at the top of Group B after all three won on Saturday. Slovakia edged a 1-0 win at home to bottom nation as striker Robert Vittek scored the only goal in the 63rd minute. Russia triumphed 3-1 at home to Armenia thanks to a hat-trick from striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, while the Irish defeated Macedonia 2-0 away as skipper Robbie Keane netted both goals to pass a half-century in internationals. Greece returned to the top of Group F with a 3-1 victory over Malta, with two goals from young attacking talent Giannis Fetfatzidis and another by teenage debutant Kyriakos Papadopoulos. That moved the Greeks a point above Croatia, who were joined on 12 by Israel following that nation's 2-1 win in Latvia. Midfielder Yossi Benayoun and Tal Ben Haim, with a penalty, scored in the first half to keep Israel's qualification bid alive. Group H also has a three-way tie at the top with Portugal, Denmark and Norway battling for automatic qualification. Portugal beat Norway 1-0 at home as striker Helder Postiga scored the only goal eight minutes after halftime. Denmark joined them on 10 points, winning 2-0 in Iceland thanks to second-half goals from Lasse Schone and Christian Eriksen. In a friendly international, five-time World Cup winners Brazil drew 0-0 with three-time runners-up the Netherlands.

The balding Manchester United player, who was booked in March's win over Wales to trigger the ban, revealed on Twitter before kickoff that he had used his time off to visit a hair specialist. \\\"Just to confirm to all my followers I have had a hair transplant. I was going bald at 25, why not. I'm delighted with the result,\\\" he wrote on the social networking website. \\\"It's still a bit bruised and swollen when it dies down u will be first to see it. Anyone recommend any good hair gel. Haha.\\\" France held by Belarus in Euro 2012 qualifier . It was more serious for Fabio Capello's team, who had to come from two goals down after goalkeeper Joe Hart was badly caught out by two free-kicks from Tranquillo Barnetta just after half an hour. Frank Lampard reduced the deficit with a penalty before halftime and his replacement Ashley Young leveled soon after coming on at the interval. The result meant Montenegro joined England on 11 points at the top of Group G after five games after also being held at home, 1-1 by Bulgaria. Bulgaria and the Swiss have little chance of earning second place and a berth in the playoffs, with both nations having five points with three matches left. England next travel to Bulgaria on September 2, when Montenegro visit pointless bottom nation Wales. Hart looked on in bemusement as Barnetta's curling set-piece drifted past his defenders and into the far corner in the 32nd minute, and he was caught out at the near post by the same player from wide out on the left soon after. However, Lampard made it 2-1 in the 36th minute when Jack Wilshere was fouled in the box by his Arsenal teammate Johan Djourou, and Young leveled six minutes after his halftime introduction after being set up by fellow substitute Leighton Baines. Striker Darren Bent blazed over the bar when he should have hit the target for England with 20 minutes left, and both teams went close in the closing stages. England manager Capello said his players were tired after a long season. \\\"You can see the Switzerland players were fresher. They have had a different season,\\\" the Italian said. \\\"We had three clear chances to score goals but at the end of the game, in the last 10 minutes, some players were without energy.\\\" Slovakia, Russia and the Republic of Ireland are tied on 13 points at the top of Group B after all three won on Saturday. Slovakia edged a 1-0 win at home to bottom nation as striker Robert Vittek scored the only goal in the 63rd minute. Russia triumphed 3-1 at home to Armenia thanks to a hat-trick from striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, while the Irish defeated Macedonia 2-0 away as skipper Robbie Keane netted both goals to pass a half-century in internationals. Greece returned to the top of Group F with a 3-1 victory over Malta, with two goals from young attacking talent Giannis Fetfatzidis and another by teenage debutant Kyriakos Papadopoulos. That moved the Greeks a point above Croatia, who were joined on 12 by Israel following that nation's 2-1 win in Latvia.

The balding Manchester United player, who was booked in March's win over Wales to trigger the ban, revealed on Twitter before kickoff that he had used his time off to visit a hair specialist. \\\"Just to confirm to all my followers I have had a hair transplant. I was going bald at 25, why not. I'm delighted with the result,\\\" he wrote on the social networking website. \\\"It's still a bit bruised and swollen when it dies down u will be first to see it. Anyone recommend any good hair gel. Haha.\\\" France held by Belarus in Euro 2012 qualifier . It was more serious for Fabio Capello's team, who had to come from two goals down after goalkeeper Joe Hart was badly caught out by two free-kicks from Tranquillo Barnetta just after half an hour. Frank Lampard reduced the deficit with a penalty before halftime and his replacement Ashley Young leveled soon after coming on at the interval. The result meant Montenegro joined England on 11 points at the top of Group G after five games after also being held at home, 1-1 by Bulgaria. Bulgaria and the Swiss have little chance of earning second place and a berth in the playoffs, with both nations having five points with three matches left. England next travel to Bulgaria on September 2, when Montenegro visit pointless bottom nation Wales. Hart looked on in bemusement as Barnetta's curling set-piece drifted past his defenders and into the far corner in the 32nd minute, and he was caught out at the near post by the same player from wide out on the left soon after. However, Lampard made it 2-1 in the 36th minute when Jack Wilshere was fouled in the box by his Arsenal teammate Johan Djourou, and Young leveled six minutes after his halftime introduction after being set up by fellow substitute Leighton Baines. Striker Darren Bent blazed over the bar when he should have hit the target for England with 20 minutes left, and both teams went close in the closing stages. England manager Capello said his players were tired after a long season. \\\"You can see the Switzerland players were fresher. They have had a different season,\\\" the Italian said. \\\"We had three clear chances to score goals but at the end of the game, in the last 10 minutes, some players were without energy.\\\" Slovakia, Russia and the Republic of Ireland are tied on 13 points at the top of Group B after all three won on Saturday.

Russia triumphed 3-1 at home to Armenia thanks to a hat-trick from striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, while the Irish defeated Macedonia 2-0 away as skipper Robbie Keane netted both goals to pass a half-century in internationals. Greece returned to the top of Group F with a 3-1 victory over Malta, with two goals from young attacking talent Giannis Fetfatzidis and another by teenage debutant Kyriakos Papadopoulos. That moved the Greeks a point above Croatia, who were joined on 12 by Israel following that nation's 2-1 win in Latvia.

# SmolLM learning 


In this series of notebooks, we'll go through different fine tuning techniques for the SmolLM families models.
The supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PEFT techniques requires a task-specific dataset structured with input-output pairs.

Hugging Face is open-souring a whole family of models: text, vision, multimodal, tools as well as examples on how to apply these models on real datasets!
